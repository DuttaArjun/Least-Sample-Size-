# Least Sample Size for Convergence to Normality
This paper gives the procedure to find the least Sample Size required for a Continuous Distribution to Converge to
Normal Distribution. We have simulated Shapiro-Wilks test to back calculate the sample size n from a continuous
distribution selected randomly. At the end we have used shiny package in R to create a dashboard and show the
simulation for different distribution.
